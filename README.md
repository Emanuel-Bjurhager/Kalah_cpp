# Kalah_cpp
C++ has been on my bucket list of languages to learn, but so far I have not had the time to really dig into it.

I have written code for C++ programs before, but in the style of C, I am now on a quest to learn the basics of C++ and learn to write code in the style of C++.

To help me, I am guided by the book “Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example” by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo.

Now all that was left was a real problem to solve, and during a game-night with some friends, I remembered that I once thought about making a console Kalah game such that a reinforcement learning algorithm could learn to play it.

So here it is, my attempt at making a console version of Kalah in C++.

Update: This is a working example using the rules I normally play with. Some people use other rules. I only had time to test the code a few games before I needed to continue with other journeys!
